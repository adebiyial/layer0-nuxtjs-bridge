# nuxt-bridge-test

Configured to deploy a `nuxt.js` project using [Nuxt3 Bridge](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/bridge)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Layer0

### Run the Nuxt.js app locally on Layer0

Run the Nuxt.js app with the command:

```bash
npm run layer0:dev
```

Load the site: http://127.0.0.1:3000

### Testing production build locally with Layer0

You can do a production build of your app and test it locally using:

```bash
layer0 build && layer0 run --production
```

Setting --production runs your app exactly as it will be uploaded to the Layer0 cloud using serverless-offline.
